This is a front-end demo for my previous imagined:  
https://github.com/drgg62086/luna/blob/main/README.md

and it may be a little difficult to use because you need to manually copy and paste the memo into your wallet 
( I don't yet know how to connect the terra station wallet on the Front End :) 

but it can at least query the data of blockchain and render it onto the canvas
